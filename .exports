# This file is for exports/environment variables that are to be shared between all shells (e.g. both bash and fish).
# For shell-specific exports, add them to:
#   bash: ~/.exports.sh
#   fish: ~/.config/fish/exports.fish
#
# THIS FILE IS SYNCED WITH DOTFILES AND SHOULD NOT CONTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION.
# IF YOU NEED SENSITIVE ENV VARIABLES, ADD THEM TO .env/.envrc OR .extras.bash/extras.fish
